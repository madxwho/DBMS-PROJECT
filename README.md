from this ^ website do the 15 steps under 'getting started with github' **BEFORE DOING ANY CHANGES IN THIS REPOSITORY** 

**also some basic stuff about all the gh terms in case u dont know**

Clone: To copy a repository from a remote server (like GitHub) to your local machine, allowing you to work on the project locally.

Commit: To save changes to files in your local repository. Each commit is accompanied by a commit message that briefly describes the changes made.

Push: To send committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository, making them accessible to others who have access to the remote repository.

Pull: To fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into your local repository. It's used to update your local repository with changes made by others.

Branch: A parallel version of a repository's codebase. Branches allow you to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. You can create, switch between, merge, and delete branches.

Merge: To integrate changes from one branch into another. It combines the changes made in different branches into a single branch, typically the main branch.

Pull Request (PR): A request to merge changes from one branch into another. Pull requests are used for code review and collaboration. They allow team members to discuss and review changes before merging them into the main codebase.

Merge Conflict: A situation that occurs when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from different branches. It happens when two branches have made changes to the same part of a file. Resolving merge conflicts involves manually editing the conflicting files to combine the changes.
